# MANISA ENGEREGI

* ANOTHER NOTE TO MYSELF: THERE IS A FUCKING PROBLEM WHILE PARSING ASSIGNMENT / COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS PARSE_EXPR AT BINARY OPS FIX IT.

program     → stmt*
stmt        → expr_stmt | if_stmt | while_stmt | block | return_stmt | method_decl
expr_stmt   → expr TOKEN_LF
block       → '{' stmt* '}'
if_stmt     → 'if' '(' expr ')' stmt ( 'else' stmt )?
while_stmt  → 'while' '(' expr ')' stmt
return_stmt → 'return' expr TOKEN_LF
expr        → assignment
assignment  → IDENTIFIER '=' expr
            | logic_or
logic_or    → logic_and ( '||' logic_and )*
logic_and   → equality ( '&&' equality )*
equality    → comparison ( ('==' | '!=') comparison )*
comparison  → term ( ('<' | '<=' | '>' | '>=') term )*
term        → factor ( ('+' | '-') factor )*
factor      → unary ( ('*' | '/' | '%') unary )*
unary       → ('-' | '!') unary | primary
primary     → NUMBER | STRING | IDENTIFIER | '(' expr ')'
